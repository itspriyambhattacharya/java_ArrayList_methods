# ArrayList and Java Collections Framework (JCF) - Useful Methods Repository

Welcome to this GitHub repository, a curated collection of Java programs focusing on the essential methods and operations provided in the `ArrayList` class and Java Collections Framework (JCF). This repository aims to serve as a practical reference for students and beginners looking to master the use of Javaâ€™s powerful data structures and utility functions, specifically focusing on ArrayLists and JCF utility methods.

---

## Contents

This repository includes:
1. **ArrayList Methods Example** - Demonstrates commonly used `ArrayList` methods with explanations.
2. **Collection Methods Practice** - A hands-on file showcasing the most useful `Collections` class utility methods.

Each example includes detailed comments for better understanding and includes a broad variety of methods that are often required in both academic and practical programming.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `Main.java`

This file provides an in-depth demonstration of methods in the `ArrayList` class. The code covers:
- **Initialization**: Creating and initializing `ArrayList`s with default and specific initial capacities.
- **Insertion Operations**: 
  - `add()`, `addFirst()`, `addLast()`
  - Inserting at specific indices and adding elements to the beginning/end of the `ArrayList`.
- **Accessing Elements**: 
  - Using `get()`, `getFirst()`, and `getLast()` to retrieve elements by index or specific position.
- **Updating Elements**: 
  - The `set()` method is used to replace elements at a given index.
- **Removing Elements**:
  - `remove(index)`, `remove(Integer.valueOf(element))`, `removeFirst()`, `removeLast()`
  - Examples on removing elements by index, by value, or from the start/end of the list.
- **Searching and Checking**:
  - `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `contains()` for searching and validating list contents.
- **Size and Emptiness Check**:
  - Methods like `size()` and `isEmpty()` are covered to understand the state of the list.
- **Cloning and Clearing**:
  - Examples on copying (`new ArrayList<>(arr)`) and clearing the list with `clear()`.
- **Sorting**:
  - Uses `sort()` to sort elements in natural order.
- **SubLists**:
  - Demonstrates `subList(fromIndex, toIndex)` to create a view of the list within a range.

#### Sample Usage

```java
ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
arr.add(12);
arr.add(1, 34);
System.out.println(arr.indexOf(12)); // Shows the index of element 12
```

### 2. `CollectionMethodsPractice.java`

This file demonstrates utility methods provided by the `Collections` class for enhancing `ArrayList` operations:
- **Bulk Operations**:
  - `Collections.addAll()` for adding multiple elements at once.
- **Sorting and Reversing**:
  - `Collections.sort()` and `Collections.reverse()` to order elements or reverse list order.
- **Finding Extremes**:
  - `Collections.max()` and `Collections.min()` to find maximum and minimum values.
- **Replacing Values**:
  - `Collections.replaceAll()` to replace occurrences of a value in the list.
- **Searching**:
  - `Collections.binarySearch()` to search for elements in a sorted list.
- **Frequency Counting**:
  - `Collections.frequency()` to count occurrences of specific values.

#### Sample Usage

```java
Collections.sort(arr); // Sorts the array in ascending order
int maxVal = Collections.max(arr); // Finds the max element in the list
```
